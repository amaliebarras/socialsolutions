```
Friendly, understandable, appealing

List any URLs of sites you find compelling. What specifically do you like about these sites?

```
http://on.carecloud.com/complete-video.html?lead_source=web&lead_source_detail=carecloud.com&ls_description=complete-video – love the directional cues (both the arrow and the background, clear what you’re going to get, makes you want to scroll  

http://www.abila.com/lp/elearning-guide/ like the look and feel, nice use of a popout window for once, consistent branding
```

### Content

Describe visual elements or content which should be utilized from your current site or marketing materials (logo, color scheme, navigation, naming conventions, etc.).

```
Here is a link to a new brand guide that we will be moving toward in the coming months. I don’t have all of the fonts in an accessible place, and we likely won’t use the slab serif on anything on the web. Please feel free to use something comparable that shows how you would translate our brand or incorporate elements. This is about the process and not creating something usable as it would never be repurposed as such! https://www.dropbox.com/s/bjogxv1qb3w37re/SocialSolutionsBrandBook_101316.pdf?dl=0  
```

### SWOT

Talked through this in person


### Approach

#### Use hierarchy and UI elements to improve user experience

* Consolidate information about the different solutions
* Create option for learning and option for demo, reducing steps to conversion
* Provide option for those unsure of budget or requirements
